# :MySquadStats: Data Entry Assistance Needed

I'm looking for some assistance in Archetyping and providing Readable Alternate Names to all the Weapons of Squad.
All further discussion can happen in: [#weapon-discussion](https://canary.discord.com/channels/1199067299177562215/1266398115171270760) in the MySquadStats Discord.

There are currently **4,833** Weapons in the MySquadStats Database. _(My list will include weapons from Galactic Contention and other Mods that would also have to be accounted for)_

### Defining `Weapon`

In terms of SquadJS and MySquadStats, a `Weapon` is anything that a Player has been wounded and/or killed by. There are some odd ones that pop up such as wreckages of vehicles being a weapon.

### Defining Weapon `Archetypes`

I would like to keep classifications and naming as close to Vanilla as possible, Galactic Contention being an exception obviously. I'm pointing towards a SquadWiki article for some reference as far as Archetyping: https://squad.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons#Weapon_Archetypes
_I would like to keep the list of all Archetypes as low as possible while still covering all options adequately._

### What this will do for MySquadStats

Getting Weapon Names done will make this tab on each Player's Stat page more readable: https://mysquadstats.com/search/76561199482222969#weaponStats
Getting Weapon Archetypes will allow for adding Ribbons based on Weapon classes.

### How to Contribute

The JSON of all the MySquadStats Weapons and the data that needs to be filled is here:
